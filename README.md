# Bird Box!

Bird Box is a simple toy music box! You can also unlock hidden songs if you play the right notes.

When I first played Ocarina of Time, I would just spend ages fooling around with the ocarina. Inspired by that simple pleasure of making sounds, I took the opportunity to learn just enough [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) to bring my own app to life!

There are currently a few hidden songs to discover. Playing a 6 note sequence will unlock the song. HINT: if you listen to [the OST](https://www.chrisdpadilla.com/birdboxost), you may be able to pick out the first few notes that start each song. ;)

You can download Bird Box from [the iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bird-box/id6743654734) or visit the game [in your desktop browser](https://bird-box-weld.vercel.app/).
